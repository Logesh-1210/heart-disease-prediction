📝 Project Description

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning-based Heart Disease Prediction System that can accurately predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on their medical attributes.
Using a variety of features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and chest pain types, the model can assist healthcare professionals in making quicker, data-driven diagnoses.

The goal is to create an efficient, easy-to-use tool that leverages Supervised Machine Learning algorithms to predict heart disease risk and ultimately help in early detection and prevention.
⚙️ Features

    Predicts the likelihood of heart disease from patient health data

    Supports real-time predictions with a trained model

    Built using popular ML libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib

    Clean and user-friendly codebase for easy understanding and modifications

    Well-documented Jupyter Notebook for training, evaluation, and visualization

📊 Dataset

    The project uses the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

    Key features include:

        Age

        Gender

        Chest pain type (cp)

        Resting blood pressure (trestbps)

        Cholesterol (chol)

        Fasting blood sugar (fbs)

        Resting ECG results (restecg)

        Maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)

        Exercise-induced angina (exang)

        And more...
